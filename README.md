Todo:

Fix session form.

Add ticks back in.

Update dependencies without breaking everything.

Push to heroku and migrate db.

Add plots.

Rethink subscription tree semantics.

Separate remote and local data.

Add server side validation.

Add autocomplete to activity fields.

Do not allow session collision.

Add change activity option to session form.

Add rename activity button.

Done:

Add "loading" elements when a visible element is waiting on a asynchronous
handler.

Break re-frame dependency.

Add time event and db spot to support a running timer on sessions.

Re-add subscriptions, but only use simple reactions. Store complex reactionary
computations in the database and compute them as an event using a handler.
Eventually partition the database into a "seed" partition and a "reactionary"
partition where the "reactionary" partition is a pure function of the "seed".

Highlight the session being edited in the session list

Remove subscriptions, pass data down through components, subscriptions create
a separate reaction on each call which causes redundant computation

Allow handler registration to happen on file load (delete register fn bullshit)
